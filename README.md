#Purpose of the application

Application management system. The system can store job Posting information of
different companies we applied and store the information in the database

#Why will this application be useful?
As cs students about to graduate, we must apply for many jobs every day. However,
when we get the interview, we often cannot find the specific information of the job we
applied for before. The system enables us to quickly search for Posting jobs we
applied for, to help us prepare for the following interview.
